# Neighbourhood batteries to support the increasing number of electric vehicles in Australian suburbs

## Project overview
The project aims to investigate whether neighbourhood large scale energy storage i.e specially batteries can bolster the expected increasing number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Australian suburbs. The project will focus on an Australian suburbsâ€™ community scale battery requirement to meet the demands of the growing EVs on the streets of Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The project will be stretched to instigate other energy storage options like ultracapacitors or fuel cells if  abundant time and resources can be allocated.
